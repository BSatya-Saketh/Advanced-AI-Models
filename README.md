Implementing AI Models like Reinforcement Learning and Federated Learning using datasets from WUSTL
Datasets: WUSTL -> HDRL 2024, IIOT 2021, EHMS 2020, SCADA 2018.

Reinforcement Learning:
  Implemented using Q-learning, and Deep Q-networks. Later compared both agents with RandomForest Classifier
  and the final results seemed perfect (~99%)

Federated Learning:
  Implemented using fully connected feedforward neural network also known as a Multilayer Perceptron or MLP.
  The final results were ~99%.
